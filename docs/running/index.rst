Installing and running Indigo
=============================

This guide is for developers who want to install and run their own instance
of the Indigo platform.

Indigo is a Django web application that can be run as a standalone project, or
as part of an existing Django project. This guide will explain how to run Indigo as
a standalone project.

Requirements
------------

Indigo requires:

* Python 3.8+
* PostgreSQL 9.3+
* An AWS S3 account and bucket for storing attachments
* `Apache FOP 2.4+ <https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/>`_  for generating PDFs
* `pdftotext <https://poppler.freedesktop.org/>`_ for reading PDFs

Optional but useful:

* An SMTP server to send email through, or an appropriate service

Using Heroku/Dokku means that we're using well-document and widely understood
mechanisms for specifying dependencies and configuration across multiple
languages. It takes care of all this for you and we highly recommend using them.

Installing Indigo locally
-------------------------

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed
2. Clone the `github.com/laws-africa/indigo <https://github.com/laws-africa/indigo>`_ repository. It has all Indigo's dependencies for Python described in it::

    $ git clone https://github.com/laws-africa/indigo
    $ cd indigo

3. Setup and activate the virtual environment::

    $ python3 -m venv env
    $ source env/bin/activate

4. Install Python dependencies. It is
   `recommended <https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html#psycopg-vs-psycopg-binary>`_ to install ``psycopg2-binary`` in
   local development only, and to use ``psycopg2`` in production::

    $ pip install -e '.'
    $ pip install psycopg2-binary

5. Install sass. The simplest is to install the node version (below), otherwise see the `sass installation docs <https://sass-lang.com/install>`_.::

   $ npm install -g sass

6. Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running. Create a postgresql user with username and password ``indigo``, and create a corresponding database called ``indigo``::

    $ sudo su - postgres -c 'createuser -d -P indigo'
    $ sudo su - postgres -c 'createdb indigo'

7. Run the Django database migrations to setup the initial database::

    $ python manage.py migrate
    $ python manage.py update_countries_plus
    $ python manage.py loaddata languages_data.json.gz

8. Then create the superuser::

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

9. Finally, run the server::

    $ python manage.py runserver

10. Visit the website to login: http://localhost:8000/

11. Configure a language and a country:

   * Visit http://localhost:8000/admin.
   * Under **Indigo API** click Languages, then click Add Language in the top right corner.
   * Choose a language from the dropdown list and click Save.
   * Under **Indigo API** click Countries, then click Add Country in the top right corner.
   * Choose a country and primary language from the dropdown lists.
   * Click Save.

12. Now go back to http://localhost:8000/ and your country will be included in the list.

PDF support
...........

Indigo creates PDF files using `Apache FOP 2.4+ <https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/>`_. Install it as appropriate for your platform.

Indigo reads from PDF files using pdftotext, which is part of the `poppler-utils <https://poppler.freedesktop.org/>`_ package. Install it as appropriate for your platform.

Django customisation
....................

You can now easily change Django settings, add your own modules, change URLs, etc. You simply need to create your own settings file, import the settings from Indigo, and update ``manage.py`` to reference your new settings file. For example:

1. Create a python module folder ``my_app``::

    $ mkdir my_app; touch my_app/__init__.py

2. Create ``my_app/settings.py`` so that it looks like this::

    from indigo.settings import *

    # override any Django settings, as you would normally.

    # add your own apps, eg:
    # INSTALLED_APPS = ('my_app',) + INSTALLED_APPS

    # add your own URLs
    # ROOT_URLCONF = 'my_app.urls'

    # etc.

3. Update ``manage.py`` so that it references your new ``my_app.settings`` file::

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import os
    import sys

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "my_app.settings")

        from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

        execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)

4. Run your updated app with ``python manage.py runserver``

Production installation
-----------------------

Indigo requires some non-Python dependencies. This guide explains how to deploy
Indigo and these dependencies on `Heroku <https://heroku.com/>`_ or `Dokku <http://progrium.viewdocs.io/dokku/>`_.
Dokku uses Docker to emulate a Heroku-like environment on your own servers (or cloud).

.. note::

    We don't recommend using Heroku for production because some Indigo functionality
    -- such as parsing new documents -- can take longer than the 30 seconds
    Heroku allows for web API calls. However, Heroku is great for quickly trying Indigo
    out.

Installation on Heroku and Dokku are similar and only really differ in the commands that are run.
We describe using Dokku below, and assume that you have already have `Dokku installed <http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/getting-started/installation/>`_.

1. Use the Dokku PostgreSQL plugin to create a database::

    $ sudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-postgres.git
    $ dokku postgres:create indigodb

2. Create a new Dokku application and link the postgres database to the application::

    $ dokku apps:create indigo
    $ dokku postgres:link indigodb indigo

3. (optional) Create a new AWS S3 account and bucket for storing attachments. You'll need the AWS Access Key Id and AWS Secret Access Key in the next step. You can safely skip this step if you don't care about saving attachments just yet. If you decide to skip this step, delete the trailing backslash (\) after the DJANGO_SECRET_KEY variable in step 4 and ignore the last three lines.

4. Set config options as follows (ensure you enter your correct database and AWS settings)::

    $ dokku config:set indigo \
        DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 \
        DJANGO_DEBUG=false \
        DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=some random characters \
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=aws access key \
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=aws secret access key \
        AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name

Indigo uses the ``DATABASE_URL`` environment variable to determine which database to connect to. This is set automatically by the Dokku PostgreSQL plugin. If you are not using the plugin, you must set ``DATABASE_URL`` yourself, using the format ``postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DBNAME``.

..
  TODO: example-indigo no longer exists, so I've just nuked the second sentence below, but does the instruction still make sense?

5. Deploying requires using ``git push`` to push to dokku. So you'll need to add ``dokku`` as a git remote on your local host.::

    $ git remote add dokku dokku@DOKKU-HOSTNAME:indigo

6. Disable HOSTS check for first deployment as this will cause a failure::

    $ dokku checks:disable indigo

7. Now deploy to dokku using ``git push dokku``. This is how you deploy any and all updates::

    $ git push dokku

8. Create an admin user by running this command **on the Dokku server**::

    $ dokku run indigo python manage.py createsuperuser

9. Install countries and languages::

    $ dokku run indigo python manage.py update_countries_plus
    $ dokku run indigo python manage.py loaddata languages_data.json.gz

10. Enable HOSTS check for future updates and ensuring post-deployment checks::

    $ dokku checks:enable indigo

11. Visit your new Indigo app in your browser at http://indigo.domain.com or http://indigo.host.domain.com (depending on how your Dokku installation was configured using the dokku domains:set-global command; read the `Dokku Getting Started documentation <https://dokku.com/docs/getting-started/installation/#2-optionally-connect-a-domain-to-your-server>`_ for details).

12. Configure a country:

   * Visit ``http://your-dokku-host.example.com/admin``.
   * Under **Indigo API** click Countries, then click Add Country in the top right corner.
   * Choose a country and primary language from the dropdown lists.
   * Click Save.

.. note::
  See the `example docker-compose.yml <https://github.com/laws-africa/indigo/tree/master/docker-compose.yml>` for inspiration.

Background tasks
----------------

Indigo can optionally do some operations in the background. It requires a worker or
cron job to run the ``django-background-tasks`` task queue. Indigo tasks are placed
in the ``indigo`` task queue. See `django-background-tasks <https://django-background-tasks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
for more details on running background tasks.

To enable background tasks, set ``INDIGO.NOTIFICATION_EMAILS_BACKGROUND`` to True.
